# Day 2

## Lab - Bash completion for oc commands (requires root privilege - hence I have already installed it for you)
In case of CentOS 7.x
```
oc completion bash > /etc/profile.d/
docker completion bash > /etc/profile.d/docker
exit
```

In case of RHEL
```
oc completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d
docker completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/docker
exit
```

How to check oc bash completion works in terminal?
- Try oc [space] [Tab] key
- Try docker [space] [Tab] key
